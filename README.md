2. Create your own Dataset by running create_dataset.ipynb file. Keep your hand gesture for less than one minute infront of camera. 
   It will automatically capture all gesturesand save it inside user defined folders of train and test automatically.
3. Then train the model by running Train_Model.ipynb file. Make the required changes in this file according to your datasets and no. of classes created.
4. Finally run the final_predict file. It will predict the hand gestures accoedingly.
